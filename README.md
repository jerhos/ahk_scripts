My personal AutoHotkey scripts

## Todos
- [ ] Integrate Rufaydium into Program.ahk to make Browsernavigation possible
- [ ] Come up with a solution for 'Custom keys' triggering morse() to early, resulting in rapidHotkey() only firing for one press
- [ ] Integrate standard morse() for long press support
